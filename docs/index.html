  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>

  <img src="assets/Headshot.jpg" alt="Elijah Watson" class="profile-photo" />
  
  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and an MPH student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, supported by an NIH F31 Predoctoral Fellowship from the National Institute on Aging and a previous National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP). I will complete both degrees in spring 2026.</p>
  
  <p>My research integrates biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course. I am also interested in applying and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.70149" target="_blank">translating</a> causal inference frameworks from biostatistics, econometrics, and epidemiology to questions in biological anthropology and demography.</p>
  
  <h2>Dissertation Research</h2>
  <p>Drawing on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines, my dissertation examines how political, environmental, and institutional disruptions shape human development and health across the life course.</p>

    <summary><strong>Prenatal Stress Signals, Postnatal Nutritional Hardship, and Midlife Biological Aging: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from the 1983–86 Philippine Political–Economic Crisis</strong></summary>
    <p>This study uses a natural experiment created by the 1983 Philippine political–economic crisis, sparked by the assassination of opposition leader Ninoy Aquino, to examine a central question in developmental plasticity: how entering a shared harsh postnatal environment with versus without prior prenatal exposure to a political–economic shock shapes biological development and health across the life course. Drawing on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, which began enrolling pregnant women just weeks before the crisis, the analysis exploits within–birth-cohort variation in gestational timing to distinguish individuals who first encountered the crisis in utero from those whose first exposure occurred only after birth, despite facing the same deteriorating postnatal conditions. Maternal nutrition remained stable at the onset of the crisis, implicating prenatal stress physiology rather than maternal caloric deprivation as the primary source of fetal signaling, while postnatal nutrition worsened steadily for all infants at the population level, creating a rare opportunity to evaluate whether early-life information altered subsequent developmental trajectories. Individuals who received any prenatal signal of the crisis—relative to those exposed only postnatally—were smaller at birth and, among girls, matured earlier, yet by midlife exhibited a lower risk of overweight and a slower pace of epigenetic aging at age 40, consistent with differences in physiological calibration rather than generalized advantage. At the same time, among the prenatally exposed, earlier and more intense gestational exposure predicted relatively faster epigenetic aging, indicating lasting costs of higher prenatal stress loads even when anticipatory cues were present. Consistent with Bayesian models of developmental plasticity, which formalize development as sequential updating of prior knowledge about environmental states based on the timing and reliability of cues, the evidence from this study indicates that—holding the postnatal environment constant—when gestational timing determines access to prenatal information about an impending and sustained environmental shift, differences in that early information exposure predict divergence in life-course biological trajectories among cohorts born in the months surrounding the onset of the crisis. These findings therefore distinguish the effects of informative versus uninformative prenatal exposure from the effects of stress magnitude, aligning with a broader literature showing that higher prenatal stress loads confer biological costs relative to lower loads, likely when placental buffering capacity for maternal cortisol is exceeded.</p>

    <summary><strong>Typhoon Odette and Gendered Climate Embodiment</strong></summary>
    <p>This project examines how climate disasters translate into mental and biological distress. In the wake of Typhoon Odette’s 2021 destruction, this study documents how typhoon housing damage was associated with water insecurity experiences, psychological distress, and epigenetic aging measured one year later among the CLHNS birth cohort. Housing damage and water insecurity were correlated with worse mental health for all participants, but accelerated epigenetic aging appeared primarily among women—suggesting gendered disparities in the embodied toll of climate shocks.</p>

    <summary><strong>Education Reform and Intimate Partner Violence</strong></summary>
    <p>This study considers institutional reform as a protective shock that redistributes the social resources buffering women from violence. Leveraging the 1988 Free Public Secondary Education Act, which eliminated tuition fees for public secondary schools, I use instrumental variables methods with national DHS data to assess whether expanded schooling reduced women’s lifetime risk of intimate partner violence. Among rural women, each additional year of schooling lowered IPV risk by roughly four percentage points, largely by delaying union formation and enabling more-educated partner selection.</p>

    <summary><strong>Pre-Vaccine Neighborhood Disparities in COVID-19 Exposure, Chicago 2020</strong></summary>
    <p>This study used Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to analyze data from a 2020 community antibody survey and estimate neighborhood-level infection risk prior to vaccine rollout. Population estimates from the American Community Survey were used for poststratification, and racialized economic segregation was measured using an Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) for race, ethnicity, and income, capturing the spatial polarization of advantage and disadvantage across the city. While the raw seroprevalence data erroneously suggested that exposure burdens were similar across Chicago neighborhoods, adjusted estimates revealed pronounced disparities, with higher infection risk in poorer, predominantly Black neighborhoods and lower risk in wealthier, predominantly white areas. The findings demonstrate how serological data and careful modeling to mitigate sampling bias can uncover inequities in infection exposure that routine surveillance based on case counts and hospitalizations cannot reveal.</p>
