  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>

  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. I am an NIH F31 Fellow funded by the National Institue on Aging and previously was funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).</p>
  
  <p>My research brings together biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course.</p>

  <p>My dissertation draws on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines to examine how political, environmental, and institutional disruptions shape human development and health across the life course.</p>
  
  <p>The first CLHNS study analyzes how prenatal exposure to the 1983 Philippine political–economic crisis influenced growth, development, and biological aging through midlife. The second CLHNS study investigates how housing damage from Typhoon Odette in 2021 affected mental health and epigenetic aging, and investigates gendered pathways through experiences of water insecurity. The third uses national DHS data and exploits a national education reform as a natural experiment to assess whether expanded schooling reduced women’s lifetime risk of intimate partner violence.</p>
  
  <p>Together, these studies trace how shocks—whether economic, climatic, or institutional—become embodied and stratify health over the life course.</p>

  <p>In parallel, my social epidemiology master’s research examined how neighborhood-level racial and economic segregation across Chicago mapped onto disparities in COVID-19 exposure prior to vaccine rollout. Using data from a 2020 community antibody survey and Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to correct for sampling bias and uncertainty in serological test performance, the analysis revealed that naive estimates from the raw data understated infection risk in poorer, predominantly Black neighborhoods and overstated it in wealthier, predominantly white areas, obscuring stark racial and spatial inequities in early pandemic exposure.</p>
