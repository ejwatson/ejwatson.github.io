  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>

  <img src="assets/Headshot.jpg" alt="Elijah Watson" class="profile-photo" />
  
  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and an MPH student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, supported by an NIH F31 Predoctoral Fellowship from the National Institute on Aging and a previous National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP). I will complete both degrees in spring 2026.</p>
  
  <p>My research integrates biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course. I am also interested in applying and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.70149" target="_blank">translating</a> causal inference frameworks from biostatistics, econometrics, and epidemiology to questions in biological anthropology and demography.</p>
  
  <h2>Dissertation Research</h2>
  <p>Drawing on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines, my dissertation examines how political, environmental, and institutional disruptions shape human development and health across the life course.</p>

    <summary><strong>Prenatal Signals and Preparedness for Postnatal Hardship: Life-Course Physiological and Epigenetic Evidence from a Natural Experiment </strong></summary>
    <p>This study uses a natural experiment created by the 1983 Philippine political–economic crisis to examine how gestational timing shapes long-term health when individuals enter the same harsh postnatal environment either with or without prior prenatal exposure to the shock. Drawing on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, which began enrolling pregnant women just before the crisis, the study exploits within-cohort variation in prenatal exposure to distinguish those who first encountered the crisis in utero from those exposed only after birth. Despite facing the same deteriorating postnatal conditions, individuals with prenatal exposure were smaller at birth and matured earlier, yet by midlife exhibited lower obesity risk and slower epigenetic aging. This pattern reflects a mixed life-history profile in which early developmental acceleration coexists with later-life metabolic restraint, consistent with developmental calibration to early information rather than generalized advantage. The findings highlight how the timing of prenatal exposure—rather than adversity alone—can shape biological trajectories across the life course.</p>

    <summary><strong>Typhoon Odette and Gendered Climate Embodiment</strong></summary>
    <p>This project examines how climate disasters translate into mental and biological distress. In the wake of Typhoon Odette’s 2021 destruction, this study documents how typhoon housing damage was associated with water insecurity experiences, psychological distress, and epigenetic aging measured one year later among the CLHNS birth cohort. Housing damage and water insecurity were correlated with worse mental health for all participants, but accelerated epigenetic aging appeared primarily among women—suggesting gendered disparities in the embodied toll of climate shocks.</p>

    <summary><strong>Education Reform and Intimate Partner Violence</strong></summary>
    <p>This study considers institutional reform as a protective shock that redistributes the social resources buffering women from violence. Leveraging the 1988 Free Public Secondary Education Act, which eliminated tuition fees for public secondary schools, I use instrumental variables methods with national DHS data to assess whether expanded schooling reduced women’s lifetime risk of intimate partner violence. Among rural women, each additional year of schooling lowered IPV risk by roughly four percentage points, largely by delaying union formation and enabling more-educated partner selection.</p>

    <summary><strong>Pre-Vaccine Neighborhood Disparities in COVID-19 Exposure, Chicago 2020</strong></summary>
    <p>This study used Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to analyze data from a 2020 community antibody survey and estimate neighborhood-level infection risk prior to vaccine rollout. Population estimates from the American Community Survey were used for poststratification, and racialized economic segregation was measured using an Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) for race, ethnicity, and income, capturing the spatial polarization of advantage and disadvantage across the city. While the raw seroprevalence data erroneously suggested that exposure burdens were similar across Chicago neighborhoods, adjusted estimates revealed pronounced disparities, with higher infection risk in poorer, predominantly Black neighborhoods and lower risk in wealthier, predominantly white areas. The findings demonstrate how serological data and careful modeling to mitigate sampling bias can uncover inequities in infection exposure that routine surveillance based on case counts and hospitalizations cannot reveal.</p>
