  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>

  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. I am an NIH F31 Fellow funded by the National Institue on Aging and previously was funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).</p>
  
  <p>My research brings together biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course.</p>
  
  <p>My biological anthropology PhD dissertation draws on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to analyze natural experiments in prenatal and early-life stress, focusing on the long-term epigenetic aging effects of a) prenatal exposure to the 1983 Filipino political-economic crisis and b) childhood exposure to housing damage from Typhoon Ruping at age six. I also examine how childhood family socioeconomic status (measured by average household wealth across childhood) versus adult socioeconomic status (measured by educational attainment) contribute to disparities in epigenetic aging in midlife.</p> 
  
  <p>In parallel, my social epidemiology master's research examines how racialized economic segregation across Chicago neighborhoods contributed to disparities in COVID-19 exposure before vaccines, using a community antibody survey and Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to mitigate sampling and test accuracy bias.</p>
