  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>
  
  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. I am an NIH F31 Fellow funded by the National Institute on Aging and previously held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP). My research integrates biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course.</p>

  <h2>Dissertation Research</h2>
  <p>Drawing on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines, my dissertation examines how political, environmental, and institutional disruptions shape human development and health:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fetal Origins of Midlife Biological Aging:</strong> Uses the overlapping timing of the 1983 Philippine political–economic crisis and the enrollment of the CLHNS birth cohort as a natural experiment to test how prenatal exposure to macroeconomic shocks shaped growth, puberty, and biological aging through midlife. Findings show that individuals who received any prenatal signal of crisis—compared with those first exposed only after birth—had smaller birth size, a higher risk of low birth weight, and, for girls, an earlier age at menarche. By midlife, however, those with prenatal exposure showed a lower risk of overweight and obesity and a slower pace of epigenetic aging, suggesting long-term physiological advantages relative to those with no prenatal signal. While having any prenatal signal was beneficial in the long run relative to no prenatal signal, within the prenatally exposed, earlier and more severe gestational exposure predicted a faster pace of biological aging relative to milder exposure, indicating lasting costs of higher-intensity prenatal stress.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Typhoon Odette and Gendered Climate Embodiment:</strong> Documents how housing damage from the 2021 typhoon was associated with household water insecurity, psychological distress, and epigenetic age acceleration one year later. Results show that while typhoon housing damage was associated with worse mental health for all, it was only associated with epigenetic age acceleration among women. Likewise, the association between water insecurity and epigenetic age acceleration was stronger and more consistent among women.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Education Reform and Intimate Partner Violence:</strong> Leverages the 1988 Free Public Secondary Education Act as a natural experiment to assess whether expanded schooling reduced women’s lifetime risk of intimate partner violence. Using instrumental-variable methods with DHS data, the study finds that each additional year of schooling lowered IPV risk by roughly four percentage points, underscoring education’s protective effects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>MPH in Epidemiology Research</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Structural Segregation and COVID-19 Exposure in Chicago:</strong> Applied Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to community antibody data to produce neighborhood-level estimates of infection risk prior to vaccine rollout. Adjusted analyses revealed stark racial and economic gradients in exposure, showing how segregation structured infection risk long before clinical outcomes were measured.</li>
  </ul>
