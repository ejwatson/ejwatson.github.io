  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>

  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. My research brings together biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course.</p>

  <p>My work is currently supported by an NIH F31 Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Fellowship (2024-2026, <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/8tfTDgwj2E-Tmnsnyj_Vbg/project-details/10900226" target="_blank">F31AG084273</a>) from the National Institute on Aging and previously a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2020-2023).</p>
  
  <p>My dissertation uses the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to study natural experiments in early-life stress, social context, and epigenetic aging in adulthood—including the 1983 Filipino economic crisis and typhoon—related housing damage in childhood and midlife——and to examine how socioeconomic status across the life course contributes to disparities in epigenetic aging.</p>

  <p>In parallel, my MPH research examines how racialized economic segregation across Chicago neighborhoods contributed to disparities in COVID-19 exposure before vaccines, using a community antibody survey and Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to mitigate sampling and test accuracy bias.</p>
