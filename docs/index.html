  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>

  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. I am an NIH F31 Fellow funded by the National Institue on Aging and previously was funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).</p>
  
  <p>My research brings together biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course.</p>

  <p>My dissertation draws on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) in the Philippines to examine the long-term consequences of early-life exposure to structural shocks and socioeconomic inequality. The central study of my dissertation investigates how prenatal exposure to the 1983 Philippine political–economic crisis shaped growth, reproductive development, and biological aging in midlife. A second project analyzes how childhood socioeconomic conditions, compared with adult socioeconomic status measured by educational attainment, contribute to disparities in epigenetic aging.</p> 
  
  <p>In parallel, my social epidemiology master's research examines how racialized economic segregation across Chicago neighborhoods contributed to disparities in COVID-19 exposure before vaccines, using a community antibody survey and Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to mitigate sampling and test accuracy bias.</p>
