  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>
  
  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. I am an NIH F31 Fellow funded by the National Institute on Aging and previously held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).</p>
  
  <p>My research integrates biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course. I am also interested in applying and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.70149" target="_blank">translating</a> causal inference frameworks from biostatistics, econometrics, and epidemiology to questions in biological anthropology and demography.</p>
  
  <h2>Dissertation Research</h2>
  <p>Drawing on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines, my dissertation examines how political, environmental, and institutional disruptions shape human development and health across the life course.</p>

    <summary><strong>Fetal Origins of Midlife Biological Aging</strong></summary>
    <p>This study leverages a natural experiment to examine how the 1983 Philippine political–economic crisis became biologically embedded across the life course. Drawing on the overlap between the crisis and the enrollment of pregnant mothers in the CLHNS birth cohort study, I test how the timing and intensity of prenatal stress shape development and midlife biology. Individuals with any prenatal signal of crisis—compared with those first exposed only after birth—had smaller birth size and earlier puberty but slower midlife epigenetic aging and lower obesity risk. While having any prenatal signal was beneficial in the long run relative to no prenatal signal, within the prenatally exposed, earlier and more severe gestational exposure predicted a faster pace of biological aging, indicating lasting costs of higher-intensity prenatal stress.</p>

    <summary><strong>Typhoon Odette and Gendered Climate Embodiment</strong></summary>
    <p>This project examines how climate disasters translate into mental and biological distress. In the wake of Typhoon Odette’s 2021 destruction, this study documents how typhoon housing damage was associated with water insecurity experiences, psychological distress, and epigenetic aging measured one year later among the CLHNS birth cohort. Housing damage and water insecurity were correlated with worse mental health for all participants, but accelerated epigenetic aging appeared primarily among women—suggesting gendered disparities in the embodied toll of climate shocks.</p>

    <summary><strong>Education Reform and Intimate Partner Violence</strong></summary>
    <p>This study considers institutional reform as a protective shock that redistributes the social resources buffering women from violence. Leveraging the 1988 Free Public Secondary Education Act, which eliminated tuition fees for public secondary schools, I use instrumental variables methods with national DHS data to assess whether expanded schooling reduced women’s lifetime risk of intimate partner violence. Among rural women, each additional year of schooling lowered IPV risk by roughly four percentage points, largely by delaying union formation and enabling more-educated partner selection.</p>

  <h2>MPH in Epidemiology Research</h2>
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Pre-Vaccine Neighborhood Disparities in COVID-19 Exposure, Chicago 2020</strong></summary>
    <p>This study used Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to analyze data from a 2020 community antibody survey and estimate neighborhood-level infection risk prior to vaccine rollout. Population estimates from the American Community Survey were used for poststratification, and racialized economic segregation was measured using an Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) for race/ethnicity and income. Adjusted estimates revealed that raw data understated infection in poorer, predominantly Black neighborhoods and overstated it in wealthier, predominantly white areas, showing how segregation structured infection risk long before clinical outcomes were recorded.</p>
