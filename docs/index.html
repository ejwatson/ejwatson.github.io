    <h1>Elijah Watson</h1>
    <p>I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and MPH student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University. I recently co-designed and co-taught a seminar on climate change and sustainability in health care for first-year medical students at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine.</p>

    <p>Drawing on my background in biological anthropology, medical anthropology, and social epidemiology, my research integrates causal inference, biomarkers, and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied over the life course.</p>

    <p>My dissertation investigates how life course exposures—such as the timing of transitions to adulthood and typhoon-related housing damage in childhood and midlife—shape the biodemography of epigenetic aging in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines.</p>

    <p>My MPH research examines how racial and economic segregation across Chicago neighborhoods contributed to disparities in COVID-19 exposure before vaccine availability in 2020, using a community antibody survey and Bayesian statistical methods to account for serological test uncertainty and sample representativeness.</p>

    <p>My work has been supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and an NIH F31 Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Fellowship from the National Institute on Aging.</p>

    <p>I completed my BA in Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2019, where I conducted research at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and the Carolina Population Center. I carried out field research in the Galápagos Islands with the UNC-USFQ Galápagos Science Center, and interned at the Scalabrini Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, supporting migrant and refugee employment access.</p>
