  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>

  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. My research brings together biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course.</p>

  <p>My dissertation uses the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to study natural experiments in early-life stress and social context, including the 1983 economic crisis and typhoon-related housing damage in childhood and midlife, and to examine how socioeconomic status across the life course contributes to disparities in epigenetic aging.</p>

  <p>In parallel, my MPH research examines how racialized economic segregation across Chicago neighborhoods contributed to disparities in COVID-19 exposure before vaccines, using a community antibody survey and Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification.</p>

  <p>Teaching and mentoring are central to my work: I co-developed and co-taught Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine’s first course on climate change and sustainability in health care, have taught in epidemiology, created applied lectures on causal inference and reproducible workflows, and authored a tutorial and roadmap for causal inference in biological anthropology (forthcoming in the American Journal of Human Biology).</p>
  
  <p>My work is currently supported by an NIH F31 Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Fellowship (2024-2026, F31AG084273) from the National Institute on Aging and previously a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2020-2023).</p>

  <p>I completed my BA in Anthropology with a minor in Medicine, Literature, and Culture at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2019, where I conducted research at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and the Carolina Population Center. I carried out collaborative field research in the Galápagos Islands with the UNC-USFQ Galápagos Science Center, and interned at the Scalabrini Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, supporting migrant and refugee employment access.</p>
