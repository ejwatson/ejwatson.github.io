  <h1>Elijah Watson, MA</h1>
  
  <p>I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and Master of Public Health (MPH) student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2026. I am an NIH F31 Fellow funded by the National Institute on Aging and previously held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).</p>

  <p>My research integrates biomarkers of aging—especially epigenetic clocks—with causal inference methods and ecosocial theory to understand how social and environmental conditions become embodied across the life course.</p>

  <h2>Dissertation Research</h2>
  <p>Drawing on the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines, my dissertation examines how political-economic, environmental, and policy shocks shape human development and health:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1983 Philippine Crisis:</strong> Analyzes how prenatal exposure to the 1983 political–economic crisis influenced growth, development, and biological aging through midlife.</li>
    <li><strong>Typhoon Odette (2021):</strong> Investigates how housing damage affected water insecurity, mental health, and epigenetic aging measured one year later.</li>
    <li><strong>Education Reform and IPV:</strong> Uses national DHS data to test whether a policy that made secondary schooling free reduced women’s lifetime risk of intimate partner violence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>MPH in Epidemiology Research</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>COVID-19 Exposure Inequities in Chicago:</strong> Examined how neighborhood-level racial and economic segregation mapped onto disparities in COVID-19 exposure prior to vaccine rollout, using Bayesian multilevel regression with poststratification to address sampling and test uncertainty.</li>
  </ul>
