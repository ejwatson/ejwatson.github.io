    <h1>Elijah Watson</h1>
    <p>I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Anthropology and MPH student in Epidemiology at Northwestern University, where I co-teach a seminar on climate change and sustainability for first-year medical students. Drawing on my background in biological anthropology, medical anthropology, and social epidemiology, my research integrates causal inference, biomarkers, and ecosocial theory to examine how social and environmental conditions become embodied over the life course.</p>

    <p>My dissertation investigates how life course exposures—such as the timing of transitions to adulthood and typhoon-related housing damage in childhood and midlife—shape the biodemography of epigenetic aging in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines.</p>
    
    <p>My MPH research examines how racial and economic segregation across Chicago neighborhoods contributed to disparities in COVID-19 exposure before vaccine availability in 2020, using a community antibody survey and Bayesian statistical methods to account for serological test uncertainty and differences between the study sample and Chicago population.</p>

    <p>My work has been supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and an NIH National Research Service Award F31 Fellowship from the National Institute on Aging.</p>
